"Grammarly is excited to offer a remote-first hybrid working model . Team
members can work primarily remotely in the United States, Canada, Ukraine,
Germany, Poland, and Portugal. Conditions permitting, teams will meet in
person a few weeks every quarter at one of Grammarly's hubs, currently in San
Francisco, Kyiv, New York, Vancouver, and Berlin, or in a shared workspace in
Krakow.

Grammarly team members in this role must be based in Canada or the United
States.

The opportunity

Grammarly empowers people to thrive and connect, whenever and wherever they
communicate. Every day, 30 million people and 30,000 teams around the world
use our AI-powered writing assistant. All of this begins with our team
collaborating in a values-driven and learning-oriented environment.

To achieve our ambitious goals, we're looking for a Software Engineer to join
our Developer Experience team as part of the wider Engineering Platform team.
This role will be responsible for making the software delivery process and
service ownership easy and convenient for engineers so that they can use their
productivity and creativity for higher objectives.

Grammarly's engineers and researchers have the freedom to innovate and uncover
breakthroughs--and, in turn, influence our product roadmap. The complexity of
our technical challenges is growing rapidly as we scale our interfaces,
algorithms, and infrastructure. Read more about our stack or hear from our
team on our technical blog.

Your impact

As a Software Engineer, Developer Experience, you will build an easy,
flexible, and customizable framework to create applications, release them, and
look after them. Using this framework, our Engineering team should have full
control over their SDLC and require minimum effort to spin up, test, deploy,
and observe their services. There is no easy way to create standard solutions
--you will always need to balance simplicity and flexibility, security and
speed, and make many other complex decisions.

In this role, you will:

* Use modern infrastructure management tools and services, such as AWS, to build a massively scalable platform for Grammarly's services.
* Manage CI/CD, artifacts and logs storages, monitoring and observability stack, and other third-party systems used by Grammarly's engineers.
* Build paved paths and tools for our engineers to speed up, standardize, and simplify the way they build, test, deploy, and support services.
* Collaborate closely with our Product teams, understand the obstacles in their way, proactively resolve them, and treat our internal developers as beloved customers.
* Participate in on-call incident response and escalation procedures.

We 're looking for someone who

* Embodies our EAGER values--is ethical, adaptable, gritty, empathetic, and remarkable.
* Is able to collaborate in person 2-4 weeks per quarter, traveling if necessary to the hub where the team is based.
* Is passionate about improving developer productivity.
* Has experience as a Software Engineer writing in Go or other languages.
* Has at least 3 years of experience building and managing a live production environment, preferably a high-load system.
* Has good knowledge and at least some experience with AWS--or has deep expertise in Azure or GCP and is willing to learn AWS quickly.
* Knows Linux--or can learn it quickly.
* Can communicate well and collaborate effectively, empathetically, and proactively on a tightly integrated team.
* Can understand a problem, see the holistic picture, and break it down into single and manageable components.

Support for you, professionally and personally

* Professional growth : We hire people we trust, and we give team members autonomy to do their best work. We also support professional development with training, coaching, and regular feedback.
* A connected team : Grammarly builds a product that helps people connect, and we apply this mindset to our own team. We have a highly collaborative culture supported by our EAGER values. We also take time to celebrate our colleagues and accomplishments with global, local, and team-specific events and programs.
* Comprehensive benefits : Grammarly offers all team members competitive pay along with a benefits package encompassing superior health care (including mental health benefits). We also offer support to set up a home office, ample and defined time off, gym and recreation stipends, admission discounts, and more.

We encourage you to apply

At Grammarly, we value our differences, and we encourage all--especially those
whose identities are traditionally underrepresented in tech organizations--to
apply. We do not discriminate on the basis of ancestry, race, place of origin,
political belief, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental

IG is a people-first company, and the purpose that they claim is to grow their people so that they can be the light for the world. But it wasn't always this way.

The company lacked a purpose bigger than themselves, and their own people were firing them, one after another. IG had truly lost their way. It wasn't until Bert Bean was promoted to CEO that the most significant changes were immediately implanted to make long-lasting improvements.

I say that because you are selling the company's staffing services and building meaningful relationships with clients in order to stimulate and contribute to the growth of the job market. That doesn't mean that it doesn't come without it's challenges.\r\n\r\nFor my first two years of account management I struggled, and I struggled real hard. I felt like I was going on an infinite number of client meetings and never seeing any return on my investment of effort. I was bending over backwards for bad business too because it was all I could get at the time.

And I continued to struggle and was constantly finding myself below my growth line. And that feeling of being stuck and frustrated were everyday emotions. But Insight Global cared about me.

In that time, I have paid witness to some very pivotal and drastic positive transformations that the company as a whole has made. If you are hired at Insight Global today, you'll truly feel taken care of both personally and professionally. IG is a people-first company, and the purpose that they claim is to grow their people so that they can be the light for the world. But it wasn't always this way. In 2017, leadership and executives finally faced the reality that the culture was broken.\r\n\r\nThe 8 core values that they claimed were simply just words on a wall. The company lacked a purpose bigger than themselves, and their own people were firing them, one after another. IG had truly lost their way. It wasn't until Bert Bean was promoted to CEO that the most significant changes were immediately implanted to make long-lasting improvements. And he did just that, leading the company culture transformation, where the company went from an attrition model of survival of the fittest, to a development model where everyone matters. That culture of development permeated into every team and corner of the company.\r\n\r\nYou'll definitely feel a sense of belonging.

Job Description

Love cutting-edge tech? We do too.

We may be the most important Internet company you've never heard of, and at

biggest brands solve meaningful problems on a massive scale--and have fun
doing it.

As a member of the Linux Systems Engineering team, you will work in a group
that is focused on efficiency, project work, compliance, standards,
situational awareness and readiness. You'll be a critical part of a fast-
moving, innovative team, providing support and expertise where needed. You
will work independently with little to no guidance in some situations as well
as working with the team in full collaboration.

What You'll Do:

* Participate in engineering, deploying, and maintaining solutions and services for internal customers.
* Act as a technical liaison to one or more internal company divisions.
* Investigate and troubleshoot TIER 3 issues with network, server, and application infrastructure.

It wasn't until Bert Bean was promoted to CEO that the most significant changes were immediately implanted to make long-lasting improvements.

IG is a people-first company, and the purpose that they claim is to grow their people so that they can be the light for the world. But it wasn't always this way. In 2017, leadership and executives finally faced the reality that the culture was broken.\r\n\r\nThe 8 core values that they claimed were simply just words on a wall. The company lacked a purpose bigger than themselves, and their own people were firing them, one after another. IG had truly lost their way. It wasn't until Bert Bean was promoted to CEO that the most significant changes were immediately implanted to make long-lasting improvements. And he did just that, leading the company culture transformation, where the company went from an attrition model of survival of the fittest, to a development model where everyone matters. That culture of development permeated into every team and corner of the company.\r\n\r\nYou'll definitely feel a sense of belonging.

The company lacked a purpose bigger than themselves, and their own people were firing them, one after another. IG had truly lost their way. It wasn't until Bert Bean was promoted to CEO that the most significant changes were immediately implanted to make long-lasting improvements.

IG is a people-first company, and the purpose that they claim is to grow their people so that they can be the light for the world. But it wasn't always this way. In 2017, leadership and executives finally faced the reality that the culture was broken.\r\n\r\nThe 8 core values that they claimed were simply just words on a wall. The company lacked a purpose bigger than themselves, and their own people were firing them, one after another. IG had truly lost their way. It wasn't until Bert Bean was promoted to CEO that the most significant changes were immediately implanted to make long-lasting improvements. And he did just that, leading the company culture transformation, where the company went from an attrition model of survival of the fittest, to a development model where everyone matters. That culture of development permeated into every team and corner of the company.\r\n\r\nYou'll definitely feel a sense of belonging. The people at Insight Global genuinely care about one another (in and outside of the office) which has created more of a family rather than a business.

I felt like I was going on an infinite number of client meetings and never seeing any return on my investment of effort. I was bending over backwards for bad business too because it was all I could get at the time. And despite all of this, I also got the feedback from my leadership that my biggest strong suit was my ability to build relationships and genuine relationships at that, and that success will come soon. \r\n\r\nSuccess unfortunately didn\u2019t come soon. And I continued to struggle and was constantly finding myself below my growth line. And that feeling of being stuck and frustrated were everyday emotions. But Insight Global cared about me.

IG is a people-first company, and the purpose that they claim is to grow their people so that they can be the light for the world. But it wasn't always this way. In 2017, leadership and executives finally faced the reality that the culture was broken.\r\n\r\nThe 8 core values that they claimed were simply just words on a wall. The company lacked a purpose bigger than themselves, and their own people were firing them, one after another. IG had truly lost their way. It wasn't until Bert Bean was promoted to CEO that the most significant changes were immediately implanted to make long-lasting improvements. And he did just that, leading the company culture transformation, where the company went from an attrition model of survival of the fittest, to a development model where everyone matters. That culture of development permeated into every team and corner of the company.\r\n\r\nYou'll definitely feel a sense of belonging.

IG is a people-first company, and the purpose that they claim is to grow their people so that they can be the light for the world. But it wasn't always this way. In 2017, leadership and executives finally faced the reality that the culture was broken.\r\n\r\nThe 8 core values that they claimed were simply just words on a wall. The company lacked a purpose bigger than themselves, and their own people were firing them, one after another. IG had truly lost their way. It wasn't until Bert Bean was promoted to CEO that the most significant changes were immediately implanted to make long-lasting improvements. And he did just that, leading the company culture transformation, where the company went from an attrition model of survival of the fittest, to a development model where everyone matters. That culture of development permeated into every team and corner of the company.\r\n\r\nYou'll definitely feel a sense of belonging.

"If you have read my job descriptions before, welcome back. If you are new,
welcome to the party....you will notice that I like to add humor to my job
descriptions...so you will see (hopefully) some chuckles as you read this.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom. I am Partner & VP at RSM
Solutions, Inc. About 95% of my time is spent 'customer facing'. That being
said, I am going to be far more interested in 'fit' than anything else...a fit
for you and a fit for the client. This also means that their are no 'layers'
between me and any of my clients as well..I am direct to all my clients.

The CIO of this particular firm is a very close personal friend of mine...he
has been there for over 30 years. You will be reporting to a direct report to
this CIO. The reason I mention this is that this particular CIO is the kind of
person that respects everyone's opinions, even if they diverge from his own.
He likes it when people actually 'do the work', as opposed to the kinds of
people 'take credit for the work'. When you have leadership like that, great
things can happen as a result.

For this role, social fit is going to be almost as important as the technical
fit. What creates a good social fit here? Well, I am glad you asked. Here are
some of those characteristics:

* This client has a pretty significant 'hit rate'. By that, I mean the people they bring on to the team typically stick around for a while. We are looking for that 'long term player', someone that wants to stick around for many years to come. So, if they see roles where you spent 5 months here, and 9 months there, on a consistent basis, they will probably take a pass. Yep, everyone has a role that stinks, but if every role you have held (especially if you have been a permanent employee) is short in duration, they will probably take a pass.
* This is an environment with limited 'drama'. They are fairly close to being around a $2B company at this point. There isn't time for instagram influencers or people who need 'participation awards' for showing up.
* This is not a 'siloed' environment where 'this is my job' and 'this is your job'. Everyone helps everyone out and they look for individuals who dive in to help others, even if it is not in your 'department'.

Here is more info on the job.

This role is being done remotely. I can only work with candidates that are
only in the US for this role. In addition, I can only work with US Citizens or
Green Card Holders for this role. I cannot work with H1, OPT or EAD Visa
Holders for this role. 
Skill Set Needed: We are seeking an Azure DevOps Engineer that can work with
migration from AWS to Azure. So, we will need someone that does have a bit of
experience in both AWS and Azure in order to have this role be a success. They
also will be moving to GitHub for source control as well. They have moved one
server already and will need to move a few more. There are a whole bunch of
dependencies that you will be working with as well. The fun part, is that you
will be working with those fantastic folks on the infrastructure team as well
(Infrastructure works on the security piece) You will be working with the
infrastructure team on requirements for the Azure environment.

Here are some of the responsibilities for the role (I have a bunch more to
share, but this should give you a good idea of what we are looking for):

* Work and support the buildout of Azure migrations for ERP (they run SAP) DW solutions.
* Migration, configuration, and support of infrastructure for corporate applications.
* Manage corporate source control solutions (Azure DevOps, GitHub Enterprise) & partner with firmware and software development teams to get them the admin control they need for their own projects.
* Assist in analysis and design using the facilities offered by Azure.
* Work with peers to develop end-to-end testing and quality assurance procedures and plans with a focus on working in the Azure environment.
* Work with those lovely BA's, end users and management to develop requirements into technical solutions in that wonderful world of Azure.
* Assist in development of project plans, budgets, and resource requirements.
* Contribute vision (don't forget to bring your glasses..attempt at humor) and integrate a broad range of ideas regarding business information definitions, processes, and analytics development.
* Provide technical leadership on complex projects (no, we aren't looking for Einstein, but if you are the kind of person that likes putting puzzles together, we are on the right track).

Here is what we are seeking:

* At least 5 years of experience with the administration of Azure DevOps Server. If you have a nice mix of TFS experience in your background, that would be nice to see. That Azure experience should include: Azure Logic Apps; Azure Service Bus; Azure API Gateway; Azure Developer Portal; Azure SQL & Cache; Authentication & Access Management in Azure
* Experience with the MSBI stack.
* At least 5 years of that wonderful world of CI /CD.
* At least 5 years of GitHub experience (from a source control point of view).
* Experience with Sql Server 2016 / 2019, as well as Visual Studio 2017.

That doesn't mean that it doesn't come without it's challenges.\r\n\r\nFor my first two years of account management I struggled, and I struggled real hard. I felt like I was going on an infinite number of client meetings and never seeing any return on my investment of effort. I was bending over backwards for bad business too because it was all I could get at the time.

IG is a people-first company, and the purpose that they claim is to grow their people so that they can be the light for the world. But it wasn't always this way. In 2017, leadership and executives finally faced the reality that the culture was broken.\r\n\r\nThe 8 core values that they claimed were simply just words on a wall. The company lacked a purpose bigger than themselves, and their own people were firing them, one after another. IG had truly lost their way. It wasn't until Bert Bean was promoted to CEO that the most significant changes were immediately implanted to make long-lasting improvements. And he did just that, leading the company culture transformation, where the company went from an attrition model of survival of the fittest, to a development model where everyone matters. That culture of development permeated into every team and corner of the company.\r\n\r\nYou'll definitely feel a sense of belonging. The people at Insight Global genuinely care about one another (in and outside of the office) which has created more of a family rather than a business.

* Manage CI/CD, artifacts and logs storages, monitoring and observability stack, and other third-party systems used by Grammarly's engineers.
